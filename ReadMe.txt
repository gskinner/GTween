The contents of this directory:

1) The "docs/" directory holds all documentation.

2) "docs.html" provides a short cut to "index.html" in the "docs" directory.

3) This "ReadMe.txt" file.

4) The "src/" directory contains all of the source code for GTween (contained in "com"), and the accompanying demos. These demos can be compiled in Flash Pro (using the .fla files) or Flex/Flash Builder (using the .as files).

5) The "swc/" directory contains a SWC with all of the GTween source files (the contents of "src/com/").

Happy Flashing,
Grant.
